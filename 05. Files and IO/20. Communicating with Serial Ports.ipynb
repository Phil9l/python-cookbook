      "of hardware device (e.g., a robot or sensor).\n",

      "# Solution\n",
      "Although you can probably do this directly using Python\u2019s built-in I/O primitives, your\n",
      "best bet for serial communication is to use the [pySerial package](http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/). \n",
      "Getting started with the package is very easy. You simply open up a serial port using code like this:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import serial\n",
      "ser = serial.Serial('/dev/tty.usbmodem641',  # Device name varies\n",
      "                    baudrate=9600,\n",
      "                    bytesize=8,\n",
      "                    parity='N',\n",
      "                    stopbits=1)\n",
      "```\n",
      "The device name will vary according to the kind of device and operating system. For\n",
      "instance, on Windows, you can use a device of 0, 1, and so on, to open up the commu\u2010\n",
      "nication ports such as \u201cCOM0\u201d and \u201cCOM1.\u201d Once open, you can read and write data\n",
      "using `read()`, `readline()`, and `write()` calls. For example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "ser.write(b'G1 X50 Y50\\r\\n')\n",
      "resp = ser.readline()\n",
      "```\n",
      "For the most part, simple serial communication should be pretty simple from this point\n",

      "# Discussion\n",
      "Although simple on the surface, serial communication can sometimes get rather messy.\n",
      "One reason you should use a package such as pySerial is that it provides support for\n",
      "advanced features (e.g., timeouts, control flow, buffer flushing, handshaking, etc.). For\n",
      "instance, if you want to enable RTS-CTS handshaking, you simply provide a\n",
      "`rtscts=True` argument to `Serial()`. The provided documentation is excellent, so\n",
      "there\u2019s little benefit to paraphrasing it here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind that all I/O involving serial ports is binary. Thus, make sure you write\n",
      "your code to use bytes instead of text (or perform proper text encoding/decoding as\n",
      "needed). The `struct` module may also be useful should you need to create binary-coded\n",
