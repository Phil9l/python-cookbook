      "# Problem\n",
      "You need to read or write text data, possibly in different text encodings such as ASCII,\n",
      "UTF-8, or UTF-16.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Solution\n",
      "Use the `open()` function with mode `rt` to read a text file. For example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Read the entire file as a single string\n",
      "with open('somefile.txt', 'rt') as f:\n",
      "    data = f.read()\n",
      "\n",
      "# Iterate over the lines of the file\n",
      "with open('somefile.txt', 'rt') as f:\n",
      "    for line in f:\n",
      "        # process line\n",
      "        \u2026\n",
      "```\n",
      "Similarly, to write a text file, use `open()` with mode `wt` to write a file, clearing and\n",
      "overwriting the previous contents (if any). For example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Write chunks of text data\n",
      "with open('somefile.txt', 'wt') as f:\n",
      "    f.write(text1)\n",
      "    f.write(text2) \n",
      "    \u2026\n",
      "\n",
      "# Redirected print statement\n",
      "with open('somefile.txt', 'wt') as f:\n",
      "    print(line1, file=f)\n",
      "    print(line2, file=f)\n",
      "    \u2026\n",
      "```\n",
      "To append to the end of an existing file, use `open()` with mode `at`.\n",
      "\n",
      "By default, files are read/written using the system default text encoding, as can be found\n",
      "in `sys.getdefaultencoding()`. On most machines, this is set to `utf-8`. If you know\n",
      "that the text you are reading or writing is in a different encoding, supply the optional\n",
      "`encoding` parameter to `open()`. For example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "with open('somefile.txt', 'rt', encoding='latin-1') as f:\n",
      "    \u2026\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Python understands several hundred possible text encodings. However, some of the\n",
      "more common encodings are `ascii`, `latin-1`, `utf-8`, and `utf-16`. UTF-8 is usually a\n",
      "safe bet if working with web applications. ascii corresponds to the 7-bit characters in\n",
      "the range U+0000 to U+007F. `latin-1` is a direct mapping of bytes 0-255 to Unicode\n",
      "characters U+0000 to U+00FF. `latin-1` encoding is notable in that it will never produce\n",
      "a decoding error when reading text of a possibly unknown encoding. Reading a file as\n",
      "`latin-1` might not produce a completely correct text decoding, but it still might be\n",
      "enough to extract useful data out of it. Also, if you later write the data back out, the\n",

      "# Discussion\n",
      "Reading and writing text files is typically very straightforward. However, there are a\n",
      "number of subtle aspects to keep in mind. First, the use of the `with` statement in the\n",
      "examples establishes a context in which the file will be used. When control leaves the\n",
      "`with` block, the file will be closed automatically. You don\u2019t need to use the `with` statement,\n",
      "but if you don\u2019t use it, make sure you remember to close the file:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "f = open('somefile.txt', 'rt')\n",
      "data = f.read()\n",
      "f.close()\n",
      "```\n",
      "Another minor complication concerns the recognition of newlines, which are different\n",
      "on Unix and Windows (i.e., `\\n` versus `\\r\\n`). By default, Python operates in what\u2019s known\n",
      "as \u201cuniversal newline\u201d mode. In this mode, all common newline conventions are rec\u2010\n",
      "ognized, and newline characters are converted to a single `\\n` character while reading.\n",
      "Similarly, the newline character `\\n` is converted to the system default newline character\n",
      "on output. If you don\u2019t want this translation, supply the `newline=''` argument to\n",
      "`open()`, like this:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Read with disabled newline translation\n",
      "with open('somefile.txt', 'rt', newline='') as f:\n",
      "    \u2026\n",
