      "# Problem\n",
      "You need to serialize a Python object into a byte stream so that you can do things such\n",
      "as save it to a file, store it in a database, or transmit it over a network connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Solution\n",
      "The most common approach for serializing data is to use the `pickle` module. To dump\n",
      "an object to a file, you do this:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import pickle\n",
      "\n",
      "data = ... # Some Python object\n",
      "f = open('somefile', 'wb')\n",
      "pickle.dump(data, f)\n",
      "```\n",
      "To dump an object to a string, use `pickle.dumps()`:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "s = pickle.dumps(data)\n",
      "```\n",
      "To re-create an object from a byte stream, use either the `pickle.load()` or \n",
      "`pickle.loads()` functions. For example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Restore from a file\n",
      "f = open('somefile', 'rb')\n",
      "data = pickle.load(f)\n",

      "good chance that `pickle` is being used.\n",
      "\n",
      "`pickle` is a Python-specific self-describing data encoding. By self-describing, the \n",
      "serialized data contains information related to the start and end of each object as well as\n",
