      "# Problem\n",
      "You need to create a temporary file or directory for use when your program executes.\n",
      "Afterward, you possibly want the file or directory to be destroyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Solution\n",
      "The `tempfile` module has a variety of functions for performing this task. To make an\n",
      "unnamed temporary file, use `tempfile.TemporaryFile`:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from tempfile import TemporaryFile\n",
      "\n",
      "with TemporaryFile('w+t') as f:\n",
      "    # Read/write to the file\n",
      "    f.write('Hello World\\n')\n",
      "    f.write('Testing\\n')\n",
      "\n",
      "    # Seek back to beginning and read the data\n",
      "    f.seek(0)\n",
      "    data = f.read()\n",
      "\n",
      "# Temporary file is destroyed\n",
      "```\n",
      "Or, if you prefer, you can also use the file like this:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "f = TemporaryFile('w+t')\n",
      "# Use the temporary file\n",
      "\u2026\n",
      "f.close()\n",
      "# File is destroyed\n",
      "```\n",
      "The first argument to `TemporaryFile()` is the file mode, which is usually `w+t` for text\n",
      "and `w+b` for binary. This mode simultaneously supports reading and writing, which is\n",
      "useful here since closing the file to change modes would actually destroy it. \n",
      "`TemporaryFile()` additionally accepts the same arguments as the built-in `open()` \n",
      "function. For example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "with TemporaryFile('w+t', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as f:\n",
      "    \u2026\n",
      "```\n",
      "On most Unix systems, the file created by `TemporaryFile()` is unnamed and won\u2019t even\n",
      "have a directory entry. If you want to relax this constraint, use `NamedTemporaryFile()` \n",
      "instead. For example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile\n",
      "\n",
      "with NamedTemporaryFile('w+t') as f:\n",
      "    print('filename is:', f.name)\n",
      "    \u2026\n",
      "\n",
      "# File automatically destroyed\n",
      "```\n",
      "Here, the `f.name` attribute of the opened file contains the filename of the temporary file.\n",
      "This can be useful if it needs to be given to some other code that needs to open the file.\n",
      "As with `TemporaryFile()`, the resulting file is automatically deleted when it\u2019s closed. If\n",
      "you don\u2019t want this, supply a `delete=False` keyword argument. For example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "with NamedTemporaryFile('w+t', delete=False) as f:\n",
      "    print('filename is:', f.name)\n",
      "    \u2026\n",
      "```\n",
      "To make a temporary directory, use `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()`. For example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory\n",
      "with TemporaryDirectory() as dirname:\n",
      "    print('dirname is:', dirname)\n",
      "    # Use the directory\n",
      "    \u2026\n",
