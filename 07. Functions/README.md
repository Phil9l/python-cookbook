# CHAPTER 7. Functions

Defining functions using the `def` statement is a cornerstone of all programs. The goal
of this chapter is to present some more advanced and unusual function definition and
usage patterns. Topics include default arguments, functions that take any number of
arguments, keyword-only arguments, annotations, and closures. In addition, some
tricky control flow and data passing problems involving callback functions are
addressed.
