      "# Problem\n",
      "You have a piece of code that can throw any of several different exceptions, and you\n",
      "need to account for all of the potential exceptions that could be raised without creating\n",
      "duplicate code or long, meandering code passages.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Solution\n",
      "If you can handle different exceptions all using a single block of code, they can be\n",
      "grouped together in a tuple like this:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "try:\n",
      "    client_obj.get_url(url)\n",
      "except (URLError, ValueError, SocketTimeout):\n",
      "    client_obj.remove_url(url)\n",
      "```\n",
      "In the preceding example, the `remove_url()` method will be called if any one of the\n",
      "listed exceptions occurs. If, on the other hand, you need to handle one of the exceptions\n",
      "differently, put it into its own `except` clause:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "try:\n",
      "    client_obj.get_url(url)\n",
      "except (URLError, ValueError):\n",

      "except SocketTimeout:\n",
      "    client_obj.handle_url_timeout(url)\n",
      "```\n",
      "Many exceptions are grouped into an inheritance hierarchy. For such exceptions, you\n",
      "can catch all of them by simply specifying a base class. For example, instead of writing\n",
      "code like this:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "try:\n",
      "    f = open(filename)\n",
      "except (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError):\n",

      "    f = open(filename)\n",
      "except OSError:\n",
      "    \u2026\n",
      "```\n",
