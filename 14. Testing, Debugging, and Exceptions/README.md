# CHAPTER 14. Testing, Debugging, and Exceptions

Testing rocks, but debugging? Not so much. The fact that thereâ€™s no compiler to analyze
your code before Python executes it makes testing a critical part of development. The
goal of this chapter is to discuss some common problems related to testing, debugging,
and exception handling. It is not meant to be a gentle introduction to test-driven development 
or the `unittest` module. Thus, some familiarity with testing concepts is
assumed.
