      "While the first rule of optimization might be to \u201cnot do it,\u201d the second rule is almost\n",
      "certainly \u201cdon\u2019t optimize the unimportant.\u201d To that end, if your program is running slow,\n",
      "you might start by profiling your code as discussed in Recipe 14.13.\n",
      "\n",
      "More often than not, you\u2019ll find that your program spends its time in a few hotspots,\n",

      "```\n",
      "A little-known fact is that code defined in the global scope like this runs slower than\n",
      "code defined in a function. The speed difference has to do with the implementation of\n",
      "local versus global variables (operations involving locals are faster). So, if you want to\n",
      "make the program run faster, simply put the scripting statements in a function:\n",
