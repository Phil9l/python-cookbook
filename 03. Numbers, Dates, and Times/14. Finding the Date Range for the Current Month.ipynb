      "This recipe works by first calculating a date correponding to the first day of the month.\n",
      "A quick way to do this is to use the `replace()` method of a `date` or `datetime` object to\n",
      "simply set the `days` attribute to $1$. One nice thing about the `replace()` method is that\n",
      "it creates the same kind of object that you started with. Thus, if the input was a date\n",
      "instance, the result is a `date`. Likewise, if the input was a `datetime` instance, you get a\n",
      "`datetime` instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, the `calendar.monthrange()` function is used to find out how many days are\n",
      "in the month in question. Any time you need to get basic information about calendars,\n",
      "the calendar module can be useful. `monthrange()` is only one such function that returns\n",
      "a tuple containing the day of the week along with the number of days in the month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the number of days in the month is known, the ending date is calculated by adding\n",
      "an appropriate `timedelta` to the starting date. It\u2019s subtle, but an important aspect of this\n",
      "recipe is that the ending date is not to be included in the range (it is actually the first\n",
      "day of the next month). This mirrors the behavior of Python\u2019s slices and range operations, \n",
      "which also never include the end point.\n",
      "\n",
      "To loop over the date range, standard math and comparison operators are used. For\n",
      "example, `timedelta` instances can be used to increment the date. The `<` operator is used\n",
      "to check whether a date comes before the ending date.\n",
      "\n",
