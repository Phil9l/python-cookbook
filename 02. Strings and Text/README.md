# CHAPTER 2. Strings and Text.

Almost every useful program involves some kind of text processing, whether it is parsing
data or generating output. This chapter focuses on common problems involving text
manipulation, such as pulling apart strings, searching, substitution, lexing, and parsing.
Many of these tasks can be easily solved using built-in methods of strings. However,
more complicated operations might require the use of regular expressions or the creation 
of a full-fledged parser. All of these topics are covered. In addition, a few tricky
aspects of working with Unicode are addressed.
