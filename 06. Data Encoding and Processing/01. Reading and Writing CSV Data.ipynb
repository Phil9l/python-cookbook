      "# Problem\n",
      "You want to read or write data encoded as a CSV file.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Solution\n",
      "For most kinds of CSV data, use the `csv` library. For example, suppose you have some\n",
      "stock market data in a file named _stocks.csv_ like this:\n",
      "```\n",
      "Symbol,Price,Date,Time,Change,Volume\n",
      "\"AA\",39.48,\"6/11/2007\",\"9:36am\",-0.18,181800\n",
      "\"AIG\",71.38,\"6/11/2007\",\"9:36am\",-0.15,195500\n",
      "\"AXP\",62.58,\"6/11/2007\",\"9:36am\",-0.46,935000\n",
      "\"BA\",98.31,\"6/11/2007\",\"9:36am\",+0.12,104800\n",
      "\"C\",53.08,\"6/11/2007\",\"9:36am\",-0.25,360900\n",
      "\"CAT\",78.29,\"6/11/2007\",\"9:36am\",-0.23,225400\n",
      "```\n",
      "Here\u2019s how you would read the data as a sequence of tuples:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import csv\n",
      "with open('stocks.csv') as f:\n",
      "    f_csv = csv.reader(f)\n",
      "    headers = next(f_csv)\n",
      "    for row in f_csv:\n",
      "        # Process row\n",
      "        \u2026\n",
      "```\n",
      "In the preceding code, `row` will be a tuple. Thus, to access certain fields, you will need\n",
      "to use indexing, such as `row[0]` (Symbol) and `row[4]` (Change).\n",
      "\n",
      "Since such indexing can often be confusing, this is one place where you might want to\n",
      "consider the use of named tuples. For example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from collections import namedtuple\n",
      "with open('stock.csv') as f:\n",
      "    f_csv = csv.reader(f)\n",
      "    headings = next(f_csv)\n",
      "    Row = namedtuple('Row', headings)\n",
      "    for r in f_csv:\n",
      "        row = Row(*r)\n",
      "        # Process row\n",
      "        \u2026\n",
      "```\n",
      "This would allow you to use the column headers such as `row.Symbol` and `row.Change`\n",
      "instead of indices. It should be noted that this only works if the column headers are valid\n",
      "Python identifiers. If not, you might have to massage the initial headings (e.g., replacing\n",
      "nonidentifier characters with underscores or similar).\n",
      "\n",
      "Another alternative is to read the data as a sequence of dictionaries instead. To do that,\n",
      "use this code:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import csv\n",
      "with open('stocks.csv') as f:\n",
      "    f_csv = csv.DictReader(f)\n",
      "    for row in f_csv:\n",
      "        # process row\n",
      "        \u2026\n",
      "```\n",
      "In this version, you would access the elements of each row using the row headers. For\n",
      "example, `row['Symbol']` or `row['Change']`.\n",
      "\n",
      "To write CSV data, you also use the `csv` module but create a writer object. For example:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "headers = ['Symbol','Price','Date','Time','Change','Volume']\n",
      "rows = [('AA', 39.48, '6/11/2007', '9:36am', -0.18, 181800),\n",
      "        ('AIG', 71.38, '6/11/2007', '9:36am', -0.15, 195500),\n",
      "        ('AXP', 62.58, '6/11/2007', '9:36am', -0.46, 935000),\n",
      "]\n",
      "with open('stocks.csv','w') as f:\n",
      "    f_csv = csv.writer(f)\n",
      "    f_csv.writerow(headers)\n",
      "    f_csv.writerows(rows)\n",

      "If you have the data as a sequence of dictionaries, do this:\n",

      "# Discussion\n",
      "You should almost always prefer the use of the csv module over manually trying to split\n",
      "and parse CSV data yourself. For instance, you might be inclined to just write some\n",
      "code like this:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "with open('stocks.csv') as f:\n",
      "    for line in f:\n",
      "        row = line.split(',')\n",
      "        # process row\n",
      "        \u2026\n",
      "```\n",
      "The problem with this approach is that you\u2019ll still need to deal with some nasty details.\n",
      "For example, if any of the fields are surrounded by quotes, you\u2019ll have to strip the quotes.\n",
      "In addition, if a quoted field happens to contain a comma, the code will break by pro\u2010\n",
      "ducing a row with the wrong size.\n",
      "\n",
      "By default, the `csv` library is programmed to understand CSV encoding rules used by\n",
      "Microsoft Excel. This is probably the most common variant, and will likely give you the\n",
      "best compatibility. However, if you consult the documentation for `csv`, you\u2019ll see a few\n",
      "ways to tweak the encoding to different formats (e.g., changing the separator character,\n",
      "etc.). For example, if you want to read tab-delimited data instead, use this:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example of reading tab-separated values\n",
      "with open('stock.tsv') as f:\n",
      "    f_tsv = csv.reader(f, delimiter='\\t')\n",
      "    for row in f_tsv:\n",
      "        # Process row\n",
      "        \u2026\n",
      "```\n",
      "If you\u2019re reading CSV data and converting it into named tuples, you need to be a little\n",
      "careful with validating column headers. For example, a CSV file could have a header\n",
      "line containing nonvalid identifier characters like this:\n",
      "```\n",
      "Street Address,Num-Premises,Latitude,Longitude\n",
      "5412 N CLARK,10,41.980262,-87.668452\n",
      "```\n",
      "This will actually cause the creation of a `namedtuple` to fail with a `ValueError` exception.\n",
      "To work around this, you might have to scrub the headers first. For instance, carrying\n",
      "a regex substitution on nonvalid identifier characters like this:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import re\n",
      "with open('stock.csv') as f:\n",
      "    f_csv = csv.reader(f)\n",
      "    headers = [re.sub('[^a-zA-Z_]', '_', h) for h in next(f_csv)]\n",
      "    Row = namedtuple('Row', headers)\n",
      "    for r in f_csv:\n",
      "        row = Row(*r)\n",
      "        # Process row\n",
      "        \u2026\n",
      "```\n",
      "It\u2019s also important to emphasize that `csv` does not try to interpret the data or convert it\n",
      "to a type other than a string. If such conversions are important, that is something you\u2019ll\n",
      "need to do yourself. Here is one example of performing extra type conversions on CSV\n",
      "data:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "col_types = [str, float, str, str, float, int]\n",
      "with open('stocks.csv') as f:\n",

      "        # Apply conversions to the row items\n",
      "        row = tuple(convert(value) for convert, value in zip(col_types, row))\n",
      "        \u2026\n",
      "```\n",
      "Alternatively, here is an example of converting selected fields of dictionaries:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "print('Reading as dicts with type conversion')\n",
      "field_types = [('Price', float),\n",
      "               ('Change', float),\n",
      "               ('Volume', int)]\n",
      "\n",
      "with open('stocks.csv') as f:\n",
      "for row in csv.DictReader(f):\n",
      "row.update((key, conversion(row[key]))\n",
      "for key, conversion in field_types)\n",
      "print(row)\n",
      "```\n",
      "In general, you\u2019ll probably want to be a bit careful with such conversions, though. In\n",
      "the real world, it\u2019s common for CSV files to have missing values, corrupted data, and\n",
      "other issues that would break type conversions. So, unless your data is guaranteed to be\n",
      "error free, that\u2019s something you\u2019ll need to consider (you might need to add suitable\n",
      "exception handling).\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, if your goal in reading CSV data is to perform data analysis and statistics, you\n",
      "might want to look at the [Pandas package](http://pandas.pydata.org/). Pandas includes a \n",
      "convenient `pandas.read_csv()` function that will load CSV data into a `DataFrame` object. \n",
      "From there, you can generate various summary statistics, filter the data, and perform other \n",
