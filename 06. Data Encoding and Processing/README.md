# CHAPTER 6. Data Encoding and Processing

The main focus of this chapter is using Python to process data presented in different
kinds of common encodings, such as CSV files, JSON, XML, and binary packed records.
Unlike the chapter on data structures, this chapter is not focused on specific algorithms,
but instead on the problem of getting data in and out of a program.
